# My First Website

This is a simple website, my first ever project that I created in Class 12th using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates my early skills in web development with a focus on basic structure, styling, and some JavaScript functionality embedded directly in the HTML file.

## Features
- **HTML**: Structured the content using HTML5 tags.
- **CSS**: Styled the webpage with basic CSS for layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: Used JavaScript within the HTML file to add basic functionality, such as form validation, interactive buttons, or animations.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `homepage.html` file in any web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
